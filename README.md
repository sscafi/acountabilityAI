# 🧾 OpenLedger – Truth Over Profit

**OpenLedger** is an AI-powered social justice bot built to expose the hidden realities behind corporate decisions — layoffs, worker exploitation, and unethical profit practices — by turning public data into transparent, data-driven journalism.

---

## 🌍 Mission
While corporations spend millions shaping their image, OpenLedger uses open data and AI to **surface the truth** — showing how executive profits, layoffs, and real-world impact are connected.

> _Truth over profit. Data over PR._

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Data Collection**
   - Gathers information from public and open sources:
     - Layoff trackers (e.g. layoffs.fyi, WARN filings)
     - Financial reports (SEC EDGAR, Yahoo Finance APIs)
     - Employee sentiment (Glassdoor/Blind data, Reddit)
     - ESG and sustainability reports

2. **Analysis**
   - Uses NLP and ML models to detect contradictions:
     - Record profits + mass layoffs
     - “Diversity” campaigns + poor internal metrics
     - High CEO pay vs median employee wage
   - Assigns an **Ethical Consistency Score** for each company.

3. **Reporting**
   - Auto-generates blog posts, dashboards, and summaries with citations.
   - Example:
     ```
     TechCorp reported a 36% profit increase while cutting 12% of its workforce.
     CEO pay rose by 18% during the same quarter.
     Sources: SEC 10-Q, WARN filings, Layoffs.fyi
     ```
